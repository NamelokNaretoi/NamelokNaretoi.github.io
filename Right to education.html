    Namelok-Naretoi wishes to continue with the Rehabilitation program in a much integrated way, as it would want to address many more areas of challenged persons / children in a diversified form, it would look other areas of children in the Maasai areas with different challenges.
    <br><br>
    With availability of funds, we also want to support <i><b> orphan-children</b></i> in our program, as well as <i><b>Girls</b> who are being abused sexually and those suffering from early marriages and Female Genital mutilation</i>
    <br><br>
    ( F G M). Most of our children in the program are orphans, many of their parents perished due to HIV/AIDS, and others were left by their grandmothers who passed off due to old age.
